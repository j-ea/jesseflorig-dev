This is my first post on my new `jsâ‰ˆfake>=real` blog! How exciting!

```sh
#test.sh
echo "hello world"
git commit -am "commit message"
```

Or in js:
```js
// test.js
const isCode = a !== b; //highlight-line
console.log("hello world");
```

```js
switch(var){
  case "one":
    return 1
  //highlight-start
  case "two":
    return 2
  //highlight-end
  default:
    return "default"
}
```

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
